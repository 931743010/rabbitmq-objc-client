# RMQClient

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-objc-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-objc-client)

A work-in-progress from-scratch implementation of a RabbitMQ client, largely
influenced by [Bunny](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny).

Currently testing from Swift and implementing in Objective-C, to avoid
burdening Objective-C developers with Swift baggage.
